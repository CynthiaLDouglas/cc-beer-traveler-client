### User Stories

- As a user I want to sign in/up

- As a user I want to read multiple posts.
- As a user I want to read a single post.

### Technologies Used

- jQuery
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- Handlebars

- MongoDB

### Unsolved Problems

- Would like to eventually ....
  - reorder posts to list from newest to oldest
  - on sign-in, most recent posts on display
  - add images to posts
  - use title to search for posts
  - There will be two types of users. One, the blogger, will be able to manage the site, the other, the followers, will be able to engage with content through commenting and favoriting posts.
