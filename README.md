# Curly Craft Beer Traveler: A Beer Travelers Blog Site

This application allows the user to read, create, update and delete posts.Over the course of our relationship, my wife and I have grown into very knowledgeable - dare I say it - beer drinkers. The knowledge that we've been able to gain over the hopped up beverage is impressive at the very least. We have lots of fun travelling to different breweries around the country. This blog will document the travels of the curly craft beer traveler.

## Planning Story

 I began this process by talking to my wife about what she would want in a blog site. I think crafted a version one of the project based on what was on her list of must haves. Once I crafted a list of user stories based on what I expected to be done by the deadline, I start on the API. After cofirming that the routes and models work with curl scripts. I began to connect each user action to the client. I continued to complete all CRUD actions and use some styling to personalize the web application. I incorporated modals using HTML and Bootstrap and CSS to further style the site. Handlebars was used to display the posts added to the database on the client. The plan moving forward to is to continue adding features outlined in the unsolved problems section.

### User Stories

- As a user I want to sign in/up
- As a user I want to create a new post
- As a user I want to read multiple posts.
- As a user I want to read a single post.
- As a user I want to update a post I own.
- As a user I want to delete a post I own.

### Technologies Used

- jQuery
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- Handlebars
- Express
- Mongoose
- MongoDB

### Unsolved Problems

- Would like to eventually ....
  - reorder posts to list from newest to oldest
  - on sign-in, most recent posts on display
  - add images to posts
  - use title to search for posts
  - There will be two types of users. One, the blogger, will be able to manage the site, the other, the followers, will be able to engage with content through commenting and favoriting posts.
